1Ô∏è‚É£ High-Impact Vulnerability Hunting on Hardened Targets
üí¨ Prompt:
"List non-obvious techniques and research strategies for discovering high-impact vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs with mature security postures. Include:

edge-case misconfigurations,

undocumented features,

logic flaw identification workflows,

endpoint discovery beyond wordlists (regex reverse engineering, sitemap poisoning, subdomain permutations),

API contract fuzzing,

and application state-machine abuse."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Platform-Level Recon & Weakness Enumeration
üí¨ Prompt:
"How do I fingerprint security controls and misconfigurations on bug bounty platforms like HackerOne and Bugcrowd? Detail tactics for:

out-of-scope target leakage,

asset overlap between programs,

target acquisition through report disclosure analysis,

metadata leaks via collaboration tools (Slack, Jira, etc.),

subdomain enumeration for private assets linked to public programs."

3Ô∏è‚É£ Mobile Application Pentesting Methodology for Bug Bounty
üí¨ Prompt:
"Design a step-by-step approach for testing mobile applications within a bug bounty program, including:

static analysis (APK/IPA reversing, manifest analysis),

dynamic runtime testing (Frida, Objection, Burp Mobile Assistant),

traffic manipulation,

API backend misconfigurations,

token/session hijacking,

and client-side logic bypasses."

4Ô∏è‚É£ OAuth Flow Abuse & Scope Escalation Techniques
üí¨ Prompt:
"Outline a precise methodology for testing OAuth authorization flows during a bug bounty engagement. Focus on:

misconfigured redirect URIs,

client-side token exposure,

token re-use or cross-account binding,

manipulating state, nonce, and scope parameters,

downgrading token privileges,

and exploiting poor session binding or implicit flow weaknesses."

5Ô∏è‚É£ Business Logic Flaw Detection Blueprint
üí¨ Prompt:
"Create a mental framework for detecting business logic flaws in modern web applications during bug bounty testing. Include techniques for:

understanding user stories and abuse scenarios,

privilege manipulation through state replay,

bypassing rate limits through logic instead of volume,

chaining misaligned authorization with workflow exploitation,

and leveraging misused trust relationships between components."

6Ô∏è‚É£ Content Discovery: The Elite Hunter‚Äôs Playbook
üí¨ Prompt:
"List advanced content discovery techniques for web application bug bounty targets. Go beyond common wordlists and cover:

recursive fuzzing strategies,

intelligent endpoint inference using machine learning output (OpenAI embeddings, Markov Chains),

CORS-enabled endpoint brute-force discovery,

extension-agnostic file hunting,

parameter miner configurations (Paraminer, ffuf, Burp Intruder),

and broken path canonicalization checks."

7Ô∏è‚É£ Automated Low-Hanging Fruit Exploitation Framework
üí¨ Prompt:
"Design an automated pipeline for detecting and exploiting low-hanging vulnerabilities in bug bounty programs, including:

outdated libraries (npm audit, retire.js, osv-scanner),

default credentials via shodan/censys recon,

exposed .git folders and sensitive config files,

SSRF, open-redirects, and XSS auto-detection,

continuous monitoring scripts for newly introduced assets,

and GitHub dorking patterns for secrets discovery."

üí¨ Prompt:
"Simulate the thought process of a professional bug bounty hunter when approaching an unknown web target. Narrate the:

enumeration steps,

decision-making heuristics,

tooling choices based on target clues,

risk vs reward estimations,

payload crafting logic,

and when to pivot strategies mid-hunt."
