General Web Application Security
1️⃣ Vulnerability Discovery: Deep-Dive
💬 Prompt:
"Generate an actionable checklist of common web application vulnerabilities including parameter pollution, HTTP request smuggling, cache poisoning, and modern XSS vectors. Include the preferred tooling, techniques, and real-world payload examples for each."

2️⃣ OWASP Top 10: Pentest-Focused Breakdown
💬 Prompt:
"Explain the OWASP Top 10 2025 web application risks with examples of how each vulnerability is commonly exploited in the wild. Provide specific Burp Suite workflows, CLI-based test commands, and mitigation controls for developers and blue teams."

3️⃣ CSP & Security Headers: Hardened App Testing
💬 Prompt:
"How do I bypass or test the effectiveness of a web application's Content Security Policy (CSP) and HTTP security headers? Give me techniques for header misconfig detection, nonce-based bypass strategies, and JavaScript gadget hunting."

4️⃣ End-to-End Penetration Testing Blueprint
💬 Prompt:
"Craft a complete step-by-step playbook for conducting an end-to-end blackbox penetration test on a modern web application, including:

reconnaissance,

endpoint enumeration,

session management analysis,

logic flaw hunting,

privilege escalation vectors,

and post-exploitation persistence."

Deliver the output in checklist format, including both manual and automated tool references.

5️⃣ WAF / IPS Evasion Tactics
💬 Prompt:
"Detail advanced payload crafting and behavioral anomaly techniques for bypassing modern Web Application Firewalls (WAF) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS). Cover:

WAF fingerprinting,

encoding obfuscation tricks (double encoding, mixed case, padding),

header smuggling payloads,

and logic-level bypass methods (using race conditions, fragmentation, or request splitting)."

6️⃣ Authentication & Authorization Audit Framework
💬 Prompt:
"Design a penetration testing framework for auditing authentication and authorization controls in web applications. Include methods for:

brute-force detection and bypass,

2FA/MFA circumvention,

session fixation,

JWT and token abuse,

privilege escalation via IDOR or misconfigured RBAC systems."

Include specific exploitation scenarios and testing scripts.

7️⃣ API Secrets & Token Management Testing
💬 Prompt:
"List best practices for secure storage and rotation of API keys, secrets, tokens, and private credentials in modern applications (Git, containers, serverless). Then provide a comprehensive testing methodology to detect mismanagement through:

source code analysis,

endpoint discovery,

accidental exposure via environment variables,

metadata leaks (AWS, GCP, Azure),

and GitHub secret scanning techniques."

💬 Prompt:
"Simulate a security consultant's internal monologue while performing a web app pentest. Think out loud, ask self-questions about:

potential logic vulnerabilities,

parameter relationships,

state mismanagement,

hidden functionality,

and developer missteps.

Output should mimic an experienced hacker's thought process during a real assessment."
