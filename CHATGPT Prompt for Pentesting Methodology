1Ô∏è‚É£ Single-Page Application (SPA) Pentesting Strategy
üí¨ Prompt:
"Draft a detailed penetration testing playbook for Single-Page Applications (SPAs) using frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. Cover:

client-side routing abuse,

dynamic component injection,

bypassing Content Security Policy via React/Angular templates,

intercepting JavaScript API calls and replaying them,

LocalStorage, SessionStorage, and IndexedDB inspection,

JWT manipulation,

state machine flaws in client-server interactions."

2Ô∏è‚É£ Black-Box Web Application Pentest Workflow
üí¨ Prompt:
"Enumerate the sequential stages of a real-world black-box web application penetration test, including:

reconnaissance (OSINT, DNS, ASN scoping),

fingerprinting web stacks and third-party dependencies,

entry point discovery,

authentication / session management analysis,

data validation fuzzing,

privilege escalation / horizontal movement,

and post-exploitation scenarios."

Add specific tool recommendations for each phase.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Hybrid Testing: Manual + Automation Synergy
üí¨ Prompt:
"Design a hybrid pentesting workflow that effectively blends manual web security testing with automated scanners and custom scripts.
Cover:

when to switch between Burp Suite, Nuclei, ffuf, and custom Python scripts,

common false-positive scenarios and manual validation tactics,

prioritizing attack surface exploration vs. vulnerability exploitation,

and integrating results into repeatable vulnerability pipelines."

4Ô∏è‚É£ GraphQL API Pentesting Blueprint
üí¨ Prompt:
"Generate a comprehensive methodology for penetration testing GraphQL APIs, including:

introspection abuse,

query injection techniques,

overfetching and underfetching data,

batch attack enumeration,

bypassing broken authorization via object ID manipulation,

automated exploitation using GraphQLmap, InQL, and Burp extensions,

and logic abuse patterns involving nested queries and mutations."

5Ô∏è‚É£ Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Testing & Exploitation
üí¨ Prompt:
"List the essential tools and techniques for identifying and exploiting SSRF vulnerabilities, including:

using Burp Collaborator, Interactsh, Canarytokens, and RequestBin for detection,

bypassing URL sanitization via IP obfuscation (octal, hex, mixed),

exploiting SSRF to pivot internally for:

internal port scanning,

metadata API exploitation (AWS, GCP),

file:// and dict:// handlers,

and chaining SSRF to Remote Code Execution (RCE) via cloud service interactions."

6Ô∏è‚É£ Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR) Mapping & Exploitation
üí¨ Prompt:
"Define a methodology for systematically mapping and exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities in modern web applications, including:

fuzzing ID-like parameters (id, user_id, profile, account) with predictable sequences,

using context-aware wordlists and logic-based pivoting,

chaining IDOR with session fixation or weak authentication,

automating large-scale IDOR detection using custom scripts and Intruder attack payloads,

and documenting business impact via privilege escalation or data exfiltration scenarios."

7Ô∏è‚É£ File Upload Vulnerability Testing Methodology
üí¨ Prompt:
"Draft a step-by-step penetration testing guide for detecting and exploiting file upload vulnerabilities in web applications. Cover:

blacklisting and extension bypass techniques (.php, .pHp3, .phar, shell.phtml),

polyglot payload creation (.jpg.php, GIF89a + PHP injection),

client-side and server-side validation bypassing,

exploiting image processing libraries (ImageMagick's ImageTragick),

directory traversal via filename manipulation,

exploiting uploaded files via path prediction or URL access patterns,

and remote code execution escalation pathways."

üí¨ Prompt:
"Outline a continuous pentesting pipeline for web applications using a mix of:

scheduled active scans (Nuclei, Nikto, sqlmap),

anomaly detection using passive proxies (Burp Passive Scanner, OWASP ZAP baseline mode),

differential analysis via previous vs. current endpoint structure diffing,

and automated exploit validation loops for common weaknesses (XSS, IDOR, SSRF, RCE)."
