# 🛡️ Pentesting Methodology — Red Teamer's Blueprint

>  **Purpose:**
> This document is a structured collection of deep-dive prompts and workflows for ethical hackers, bug bounty hunters, and pentesters who aim to perform advanced and modern web security assessments.

---

## 1️⃣ Penetration Testing Methodology for Single-Page Applications (SPAs)

**Prompt:**

> Create a step-by-step penetration testing blueprint for modern SPAs (React, Angular, Vue). Include:
>
> - Identifying frontend-to-backend API contracts.
> - Validating JWT handling and session storage practices.
> - Testing for exposed environment variables via JavaScript.
> - Evaluating token-based authorization in asynchronous flows.
> - Broken state management exploitation opportunities (cache poisoning, race conditions).
> - Frontend misconfigurations: source maps, hardcoded secrets, misused third-party libraries.
> - Client-side logic vs server-side validation gaps.

---

## 2️⃣ Black-Box Penetration Testing for Web Applications

**Prompt:**

> Outline a black-box pentesting flow for web apps, where no code access is provided:
>
> - Passive reconnaissance (WHOIS, Censys, Shodan).
> - Active discovery (subdomain brute-forcing, virtual host fuzzing).
> - Web content discovery using `ffuf`, `dirsearch`, and `gobuster`.
> - Automated scanning (Nmap, Nikto, Burp Scanner).
> - Manual validation and exploit crafting.
> - Post-exploitation enumeration.
> - Reporting and reproducibility checks.

## 3️⃣ Hybrid Penetration Testing: Manual + Automated Tools

**Prompt:**

> Design a hybrid testing strategy combining human creativity and automation:
>
> - Automate repetitive endpoint fuzzing with `ffuf`, `nuclei`, and `httpx`.
> - Use Burp Suite’s active scanner for automated detection.
> - Validate findings manually for business logic flaws.
> - Use extensions (`Autorize`, `Flow`, `Logger++`) for manual-assisted automation.
> - Prioritize depth over breadth: balance automation scale with manual inspection accuracy.

---

## 4️⃣ Methodology for Testing GraphQL API Endpoints

**Prompt:**

> Provide a complete GraphQL API pentesting methodology:
>
> - Check for introspection (`__schema`) availability.
> - Identify mutations and query injection points.
> - Exploit over-fetching and nested queries for data leakage.
> - Test for BFLA (Broken Function Level Authorization).
> - Automate fuzzing using `InQL` and `GraphQLmap`.
> - Detect mass assignment and rate-limit bypass patterns.

---

## 5️⃣ SSRF Testing: Tools & Techniques

**Prompt:**

> List your pentesting playbook for SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):
>
> - Detection using DNS loggers (`Burp Collaborator`, `Interactsh`).
> - Testing IP range bypasses (`127.0.0.1`, `::1`, decimal, octal, hex notation).
> - Using `ffuf` for SSRF payload injection points.
> - Targeting cloud metadata services (`169.254.169.254` on AWS).
> - SSRF chained to RCE (Remote Code Execution) cases.
> - Mitigation analysis post-discovery.

---

## 6️⃣ Mapping and Testing for Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR)

**Prompt:**

> Design a methodology for IDOR hunting:
>
> - Identify numerical and UUID-based object references in requests.
> - Test horizontal and vertical privilege escalations.
> - Use `Autorize` and custom Burp macros to automate token swapping.
> - Explore hidden IDOR through GraphQL/REST inconsistencies.
> - Apply token leakage analysis to find secondary reference points.
> - Create an IDOR proof-of-concept report template.

---

##  7️⃣ Pentesting File Upload Vulnerabilities

**Prompt:**

> Build a pentesting playbook for file upload bugs:
>
> - Content-Type spoofing (`image/png` → PHP shells).
> - Extension bypasses (`.jpg.php`, double extensions).
> - Case sensitivity exploits (`.pHp`, `.PHp3`).
> - Client-side vs server-side validation bypass.
> - Path traversal in upload destination (`../../evil.php`).
> - VirusTotal evasion pre-checks for payload acceptance.
> - Out-of-Band (OOB) verification of code execution post-upload.

---

## Vulnerability Chaining & Reporting

**Prompt:**

> Create a guide for chaining multiple vulnerabilities during an assessment:
>
> - Combine IDOR + File Upload = Remote Webshell.
> - Combine SSRF + Credential Leakage = Cloud Takeover.
> - Combine Logic Flaw + Rate Limit Bypass = Bulk Data Exfiltration.
>
> Emphasize risk amplification in your final report. Include reproduction steps and attack diagrams for clear communication.
